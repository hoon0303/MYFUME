# Perfume Recommendation ( MYFUME )

MYFUME is a personalized perfume recommendation system that leverages meta-information to extract latent knowledge and provide tailored perfume suggestions. This repository demonstrates the working code for the recommendation algorithms and machine learning models used in MYFUME, with a focus on visualizing and analyzing the extracted meta-information features.

## Analysis and Insights
The perfume dataset is utilized for data quality validation, encompassing various classifications of meta-information concerning the scent of perfumes. Verification is conducted by analyzing the distribution of main categories via a scatter plot of clusters.

### Metainformation Features

For the validation process, seven primary scent categories of perfumes were investigated. Each of these categories signifies a distinctive scent attribute of a perfume. The relational proximity among the primary scent categories was determined, dictating the varying color intensities on the scatter plot.

A notable observation from the results is the evident correlation between main categories and their respective meta-information. For instance, the Citrus category is predominantly characterized by refreshing fruit aromas. This is corroborated in the scatter plot, where scents akin to Chypre Fruity and Floral Green exhibit attributes common to the Citrus category. In another instance, Aromatic Fougere, characterized by its sharp yet subtly sweet fragrance enriched with woody notes, aligns with the Woody category. These inter-relationships, affirmed via sensory evaluations, help in discerning connections that are often elusive in standard datasets. In essence, these outcomes underline the capability of meta-information features to encapsulate and elucidate latent perfume-specific knowledge effectively.
